# polltest
This application lets the users vote for their favorite Author with radio buttons.
Here I have used CodeIgniter to make things go easy and with oops paradigm.
The user is able to view the result of the above poll by clicking the result button, where the user is taken to a new page and the result in tabular format is shown, with the highest vote reciever highlited.
To get a more visualised view of numbers, the user may opt to see the result by a Graph, for which he/she shoul press the 'view chart' button on result page to navigate to the view chart page where the a bar chart showing the result is shown.
The whole application works dynamically in real time.
